			<img class="places" src="img9.jpg" alt="Delphi">

	views, stunning sunsets, the white-washed houses, and its very own active volcano. Fira, the capital 
	of Santorini, is a marriage of Venetian and Cycladic architecture, whose white cobblestone streets

		<div class="tourismplaces">
			<h2>8-Meteora</h2>
			<img class="places" src="img3.jpg" alt="Meteora">
			<pre>	The Greek word meteora means “suspended in the air,” and this phrase aptly describes the
	spectacular cliffs that rise more than 1,200 feet (366 meters) into the air overlooking the villages of
	Kalambaka and Kastraki in the north central mainland of Greece.
	What makes these cliffs even more inspiring are the historic monasteries perched along the
	summits. Dating back to the 14th and 16th centuries, the monasteries at Meteora were built by
	monks seeking spiritual isolation and freedom from religious persecution.

	down through the centuries.

	business, culture and nightlife.
