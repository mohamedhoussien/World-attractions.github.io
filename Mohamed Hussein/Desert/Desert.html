                It looks like the North Pole or the icy Siberian desert.” This is how Western Desert travelers called it, but its scorching sun, and hot winds, took it out of this cold classification.
                The "White Desert"... Here the imagination embraces reality, so that you imagine that nature harmonizes in comic boyish dances to create that contrasting scene between the hot weather and the cold icy image. It is located 45 kilometers north of the Farafra Oasis, 570 kilometers from Cairo. Its area is 3010 km².
                A world of drifting sand and fleeting wealth, and a long history through time that can be discovered through this natural landscape. The scattered fossils on its white land are a clear indicator of climate change in that region throughout history, and its rocks date back to the Cretaceous period, which dates back to 70 million years ago, and was formed As a result of the inundation of the Tethys Sea that area.
                In the heart of the White Desert is a natural museum of chalk rock. Only here you can see the chicken next to the atomic bomb, or what some call “chicken and mushrooms”, which is the rock that has been used as a emblem for the region since it was declared a nature reserve in 2002, and there are many rocks that are famous for their names according to Because of its sculptural shape, the most famous of which is the camel, horse, and falcon rock, in addition to the sand known as African rocks, because it takes the form of the continent of Africa as if it were a meticulously drawn map.
                There is also an infinite variety of shapes and colors, small crystals of calcium carbonate and iron pyrite nodules, in addition to the playa, which is one of the remnants of an ancient lake that has been eroded through the ages. The smallest oasis of the Western Desert, mentioned in ancient Pharaonic times, was known as "Taht", meaning the land of the cow, a name derived from the god Hathor, and the ancient Egyptians called it this title due to the large number of pastures and cows in it.
                In Roman times, Farafra, the interior oases, and the Bahariya oasis were called “the land of the grain,” due to the Roman Empire’s dependence on it for grain, and there are still remains of the buildings of this era, including the Farafra Palace, the “Ain Bas” temple, in addition to rock tombs free of inscriptions
                Farafra was the only refuge for Christians who were persecuted by the Romans in the first Christian era, and there are clear fingerprints for them in the areas of Al-Qasr Abu Saeed, Ain Ibshaway, and Wadi Hanas. In the Islamic era, the trade in dates and olives flourished, so that the convoys carried the products of the oasis to Derut, She returns to it with fabrics and tea.
                In the modern era, Khedive Ismail in 1874 diverted the trip of the famous German scientist "Gerhard Rolf" to it, to search about the fact that there was a river without water in the region, and Rolf tried to penetrate the Great Sea of ​​Sand, which is located west of Farafra, but he was unable to do so. So he headed north with a convoy of 100 camels and 90 men, 12 of whom hold German citizenship, carrying various branches of science, such as geology, botany, zoology, archeology, astronomy, and surveying, and he published his book “Three Months in the Western Desert.”
                Farafra is considered the most isolated oasis, so its inhabitants are characterized by linguistic and intellectual homogeneity, and they are of Arab origin that adhere to inherited customs and traditions, and those who set foot on their land must follow their local traditions. They belong to 6 tribes: the Hananawa, the Ayyadiyah, the Rakabiya, the Rumaihat, the Qadadra, and the Akarta. Some of them came from Upper Egypt, and some of them came from the Arabian Peninsula, Libya, and Tunisia.
                In the past, the White Desert was teeming with humans, and the inscriptions and decorations that adorn the walls of the "Al-Obeid" cave came as evidence of the civilization that prevailed in this region 10 thousand years ago. These inscriptions are animal motifs that reflect the traditions of Nubian rock art, and there are drawings of two hands. Two humans adorned the cave walls.
                In the vicinity of the cave, there is a plateau on which lies the structures of mysterious monuments whose stories have faded from memory over time, but they refer in any case to those ephemeral eras, and a prehistoric man left his inscriptions at the entrance to the neighbor’s cave, which is one of the rarest caves in the world. In limestone sediments, its age reaches 40 million years. It is located near Wadi Muharraq, after the White Desert Reserve, about 7 km towards Asyut. It was discovered by German Gerhard Rolfes in 1873.
                Al-Jara Cave is a depression under the surface of the earth topped by a high hill, and its entrance is a small opening below the hill, which is connected by a narrow sloping corridor, filled with sand. The dryness of the desert over millions of years, and it contrasts with all the caves of the region in its formations and the form of its sediments that look like fiery waterfalls, and the heights of the sedimentary formations, according to Rolfes’ description, reach three or four feet.
                Visitors to the white desert usually prefer camping in it, as there is no other place where so many stars appear in the sky, as the Milky Way appears in its sky clearly above the rocks, and the planet Venus shines to decorate the night sky with its light.
