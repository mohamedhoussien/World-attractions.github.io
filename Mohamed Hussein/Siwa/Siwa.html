            <p class="paragraph">
                Some believe that the name Siwa came from the word “Sikht am” meaning the land of palm trees, or it goes back to the old name “That.” The oasis was called in the past by many names, including “Penta”, and this name was found in one of the texts recorded in the Temple of Edfu, and it was called “Oasis of Amun” until the era of the Ptolemies, who called it “the Oasis of Jupiter Amun”, and the Arabs knew it as “Al-Aqsa Oasis”, which is the name that was mentioned Al-Maqrizi's plans. While Ibn Khaldun referred to it as “Tenisawa”, which is the name of a branch of the Zintana tribes in North Africa, as Al-Idrisi referred to it as “Sentari”, and said that it is inhabited by a people mixed between Berbers and Bedouins.

            <h2> Date:</h2><br>
            <h5>Antiquity</h5><br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Before the year 2900 BC, a people of the Libyans known as the people of annihilation or relinquishment continued to attack Lower Egypt, and they used the Siwa Oasis as a center for their encroachment on Egypt, so King "Sneferu", the last king of the Third Dynasty, attacked and seized the oasis, to avoid the evil of the Libyans. In 1970 BC, the Libyan tribes raided Lower Egypt through Siwa, and King Sesostris, the second king of the Twelfth Dynasty, fought them to return them to their country defeated. In 1547 BC, the Libyans attacked Egypt, taking advantage of its ruler's preoccupation with the war in the country of Nubia, but King "Amenhotep I" inflicted heavy losses on them. During the reign of King "Menftah", the pharaoh repelled the attack of the Libyans by land and sea.

                <h5>Cambyses army</h5><br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                Before the Persian occupation of Egypt, their leader Cambyses sent his army to occupy Siwa, which the priests of the god Amun in her temple had predicted a fatal end to him. He prepared an army of fifty thousand soldiers to demolish the temple of Amun and occupy the oasis, but this army lost its way and perished in the desert and did not reach Siwa. After that incident, the prophecy of the priests in Cambyses was fulfilled, so he fell ill and died.

                <h5>Visit Alexander the Great</h5><br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After Alexander the Great entered Egypt and established the city of Alexandria, he decided to visit the Temple of Amun in Siwa, which gained wide fame after the incident of the Cambyses army. In the winter of 331 BC, Alexander arrived at the temple of Amun in Siwa, and the high priest escorted him to the Holy of Holies - a dark room that only the high priest and the king could enter - and he did not allow any of his assistants to accompany him. When Alexander left the temple, he seemed relieved, and refused to reveal what happened inside, and all he said to his friends was, "I heard what my heart loves."

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Siwa remained independent in its civilization and way of life after the Islamic conquest of Egypt. The leader Musa bin Naseer tried to conquer it in the year 708 AD during the Umayyad era as ruler of North Africa. He moved to it and found a city surrounded by a great fortress with iron doors, but he found it difficult to enter and left it, It is likely that the entry of the Islamic religion to Siwa was before the end of the first century AH. In 969 AD, the Fatimid armies captured the oasis.

                    In February 1820, Muhammad Ali Pasha prepared an expedition of 1,300 soldiers led by Hassan Bey Al-Shamasherji to conquer Siwa. Fighting broke out between the forces and the people of the oasis, which ended with the victory of Muhammad Ali's forces and their recognition of loyalty to the Egyptian government. In the modern era, the armies of the axis entered the oasis and occupied it on July 20, 1942, and evacuated them from it on November 8, 1942, after their defeat in the Battle of El Alamein.
