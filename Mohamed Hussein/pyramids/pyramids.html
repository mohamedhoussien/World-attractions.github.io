            <h2> Building</h2><br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The construction of the Great Pyramid took nearly twenty years and the construction of the corridors and the lower parts of the pyramid ten years, according to Herodotus, the Greek historian who visited Egypt in the fourth century BC, after more than 2,000 years of building the pyramid and heard these and other stories from some priests and narrators. The stones that were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid are from the area surrounding the pyramid, and the outer cladding stones are from the Jabal Tora area, and the granite stones used in the inner chambers are from the Aswan quarries, and they were brought by the Nile River, which was reaching the pyramid area at that time. The stones were cut and separated from each other by making holes at close distances in the piece of stones to be cut, then some wooden pegs were hammered in them and hammering on them while putting water on them. buffing and polishing them using a stronger type of stone such as granite or diorite. The ancient Egyptians used a sandy road to build the pyramids, where pieces of stones are placed on wooden sledges underneath which are round palm trunks that work like wheels. From top to bottom, gradually removing sand.

            <h2> Why the hierarchical shape?</h2><br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The hierarchical form of the ancient Egyptians was associated with the idea of ​​the emergence of the universe, and they also believed, according to some of their writings and religious texts, that the pyramid is a means that helps the soul of the deceased to reach the sky with the god Ra, and we can sometimes see the rays of the sun among the clouds and it also takes the pyramid shape and it was among these many means that can help them ascend to heaven. We also see the pyramidal shape at the top of the obelisks and some small tombs of individuals in southern Egypt, even when the kings of the modern state thought about building their tombs on the western mainland in the Valley of the Kings and carving them in the bottom of the mountain to protect them from theft, they did not abandon the pyramidal shape, which was naturally represented at the top of the mountain itself .

        <h2>pyramids and Sphinx</h2><br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The Giza pyramid complex consists of the Great Pyramid (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or Khufu and erected around 2580 - 2560 BC), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre, located a few hundred meters to the southwest, and the relatively modest Pyramid of Menkaure, a few Hundreds of meters to the southwest. The Great Sphinx is located on the eastern side of the complex. Most Egyptologists today agree that the head of the Great Sphinx is that of King Khafre. In addition to these main monuments, there are a number of small monuments affiliated with it, known as the pyramids of "queens", bridges and the pyramids of the valley.

            <h2> Pyramid of Khufu (Great Pyramid)</h2><br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Khufu was succeeded by his father, Sneferu, and his mother is Queen Hetepheres I. Khufu, 2650 BC, is the short name for “Khnum Kho av Uy,” meaning (Khnum is the one who protects me). History mentions Khufu that he built the greatest building on earth, the Great Pyramid of Giza, the only surviving miracle of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Its grandeur is due not only to the immensity of its construction, but also to its impressive compact interior layout. A cemetery was built around it, with small pyramids for his wives and his mother, Hetepheres, in addition to tombs in the form of terraces for members of the royal family and senior officials. The original height of the Great Pyramid is 146 meters, and currently it is approximately 137 meters, and the length of its base side is 230 meters. As for the weights of cut stones, they range from one ton to eight tons or more. But can we imagine that this king, the owner of this giant building, we found only one very small statue of him, the size of which is approximately 7.5 cm, and from later times, as the king at this time forbade the erection or sculpting of any statues, as we did not find large statues in During this period, only one statue was hidden in the tomb of Prince Rahotep and his wife. Perhaps the king wanted to begin by himself to prevent the erection of statues. King Khufu called his pyramid “Akhet Khufu,” meaning the horizon of Khufu, due to the religious changes that occurred in his era. Stadelmann explained that Khufu had departed from the Egyptian faith and established himself as a deity.

The pyramid of King Khufu has not been spared from destruction throughout the ages. Diodorus the Sicilian pointed out that the top of the Great Pyramid is a platform about 3 meters wide and two meters long. But the top of the pyramid is not a platform, but a pyramid that may have been covered with gold. Part of his clothing was destroyed and lost.

The pyramid of King Khufu was surrounded by a wall, the remains of which are still standing, in the eastern and northern sides, at a distance of 20 m from the base of the pyramid.

            <p class="paragraph">

He married Princess Ankh berths. Twenty-six years rule. The second pyramid was built from the pyramids of Giza, and it is lower than the pyramid of his father (Khufu). Its height was 143 meters and now it is 136 meters.

                It was built over an area of ​​215 square meters. It has two entrances on the north side. It still retains part of its outer covering at the top. Within its hierarchical group, statues of schist stone were found in the private valley temple, including a statue of the most beautiful Egyptian sculpture produced, and it is located in the Egyptian Museum, and is attributed to him carving the rock of the Sphinx.

                The pyramid of Khafre is located southwest of the pyramid of his father Khufu. Its height is 143.5 meters, the length of each side is 215.5 meters, and the angle of inclination is 53.10 degrees. It is located at ground level, and the entrance leads to a descending corridor, with a granite roof and a slope of 22 degrees. It ends at a parapet that leads to a horizontal corridor, then a ramp leading to a cellar mistakenly called the burial chamber, which is empty carved in the rock, and the vestibule leads to another parapet that rises upward with a horizontal corridor that ends with the burial chamber. The pyramid, Khafre called his pyramid (the Great).

                <h2> The pyramid of Menkaure (the smaller pyramid) </h2><br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The Pyramid of Menkaure or the Pyramid of Menkaure is the smallest of the three pyramids of Giza in Egypt. It was built by King Menkaure, son of King Khafre of the Fourth Egyptian Dynasty. The length of each of its sides is 108.5 meters, its height is 65.5 meters, and it is now 62 meters long after the fall of its outer covering.

                    Its tilt angle is 51°20′25″ (Saqd 53/5), and its entrance is to the north. The entrance rises about 4 meters above the ground, and leads to a 31-meter-long descending corridor. And the angle of incline is simple about 17 degrees. It was built of limestone, but Menkaure chose to build the lower part of it from the granite that was brought from Aswan via the Nile River. The height of the granite stone coverage is about 17 meters. The rest of the coverage was done with white tora stones up to a height of 5.65 meters.

                    At the end of the inclined corridor there is a vestibule lined with stone, leading to a horizontal corridor with 3 barricades, and then the burial chamber. A wooden coffin with the name of Menkaure and his mummy was found in him. The mummy of Menkaure is now preserved in the British Museum. Menkaure called his pyramid (al-Muqaddas).

                    To the south of the pyramid of Menkaure, there are three pyramids dedicated to queens, extending to the east, west of the first pyramid, belonging to Queen Khamarr Napati, the second wife of King Menkaure.
