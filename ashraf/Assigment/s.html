        <h2>The Black Forest</h2>
        <img src="one.jpg" width="100%" height="600">
        <p>The beautiful Black Forest with its dark, densely-wooded hills is one of the most visited upland regions in
            all of Europe. Situated in the southwestern corner of Germany and extending 160 kilometers from Pforzheim in
            the north to Waldshut on the High Rhine in the south, it's a hiker's heaven.
            On the west side, it descends steeply to the Rhine, crossed by lush valleys, while on the east, it slopes
            more gently down to the upper Neckar and Danube valleys. Popular spots include Germany's oldest ski area at
            Todtnau, the magnificent spa facilities of Baden-Baden, and the attractive resort of Bad Liebenzell.</p>

            <h2>The Island of Rügen</h2>
            <img src="two.jpg" width="100%" height="600">

            <p>Rügen is the largest and most beautiful of the German Baltic islands. Separated from the rest of Germany
                by
                the Strelasund,
                it's linked to the mainland town of Stralsund by a causeway. The island's beauty stems from its
                diversity of
                landscape,
                including everything from flat farmland and forest-covered hills to expansive sandy beaches,
                lagoons,
                and lovely peninsulas. A fun thing to do here,
                especially for outdoor enthusiasts,
                is to pay a visit to the Jasmund Peninsula,
                which in places reaches heights of 161 meters. Here,
                you'll find Jasmund National Park, popular among nature
                lovers for its abundance of wildlife,
                with notable species found here,
                including rare white-tailed eagles. </p>

            <h2>Rothenburg ob der Tauber</h2>
            <img src="three.jpg" width="100%" height="600">
            <p>The old Franconian imperial city of Rothenburg is one of the most attractive places to visit on Germany's
                famous Romantic Road tourist route. Located on the steep banks of the picturesque River Tauber,
                it's notable
                for its walls and towers,
                untouched since the Thirty Years War of 1618. This completely preserved,
                picture-perfect medieval town offers endless charm. One of the most popular things to do in Rothenburg
                ob
                der Tauber is to join a walking tour (or do it yourself);
                get started by picking up a map from one of the tourism offices located in the town. </p>

            <h2>Zugspitze Massif</h2>
            <img src="four.jpg" width="100%" height="600">
            <p>
                The Zugspitze is also an attractive destination for non-skiers in winter: Right at the top, an
                impressive
                360° panorama opens up to reveal extensive
                views over 400 mountain peaks in four countries. The Zugspitze-Exhibition enhances visitors’ awareness
                of
                the historical developments of Germany’s
                most famous mountain. Three toboggan runs, Germany’s highest church, an igloo village and excellent
                mountain
                restaurants are reason enough for
                smiling faces. Only while sunbathing on the inviting deckchairs may you find that your eyelids droop for
                a
                well-earned snooze.

            <h2>Munich's Marienplatz </h2>
            <img src="fifth.jpg" width="100%" height="600">
            <p>Marienplatz was named after the Mariensäule, a Marian column erected in its centre in 1638 to celebrate
                the
                end of
                Swedish occupation. Today the Marienplatz is dominated by the New City Hall (Neues Rathaus) on the north
                side, and
                the Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus, a reconstructed gothic council hall with a ballroom and tower) on the
                east
                side.
