            <p> Hotel El Palace Barcelona was totally refurbished and reopened late 2009. The works preserved the classic spirit that has always characterised this property, distinguished as a symbol of Barcelonaâ€™s hotel tradition. Set in the heart of the
                city centre, close to Las Ramblas and in the most prestigious shopping area, it is surrounded by boulevards, theatres and main banks. It has an excellent transport connections and it is just 20 min from el Prat Airport.After the restoration,
                the Hotel has 120 rooms, 42 of which are suites and junior suites,</p>

            <p>This property was beautiful, the service was first class and the location was perfect. The hotel is elegant and well maintained. The rooms are spacious with updated bathrooms including double sinks, stall showers and separate bathtubs. The
                lobby bar is opulent and classy with friendly and efficient service. The hotel is walking distance to tons of shops, restaurants and attractions. The staff went out of their way to be helpful in every way. One night it was raining so hard,
                the doorman stood on the street in the rain for over 5 minutes tracking down a taxi for us and made sure the taxi driver knew where to take us. There was turn down service every night and water and towels were always replenished. The only
                negative was the very tiny gym. But we loved the hotel and would definitely stay here again.</p>
