            <p> It is considered one of the most important and beautiful castles of Granada , Centered by a pond of water and shaded by basil trees; And in the corners of the courtyard of Al-Rayhan were engraved (Victory, Empowerment, and Conquest of Our
                Lord Abi Abdullah, Commander of the Faithful...) and the noble verse (And victory is only with God, the Mighty, the Wise for this), and at the southern end of the hall a huge Arab door, the buildings behind it were demolished, and none
                of them remained Only ruins. In these ruins there are some inscriptions such as There is no victor but God and Glory be to our master, Sultan Abi Abdullah Al-Ghani Billah. The door of the northern courtyard of Al-Rayhan leads to a small
                hall called Al-Baraka Hall. </p>
