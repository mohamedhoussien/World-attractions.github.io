     <img src="qqqqq.jpg" width="1300" height="500">
      <p>It is a castle located in Cambridge, in the county of Cambridgeshire, England  
         The castle was originally built after the Norman conquest of England in order to control the important strategic route to the north
        and the castle played an important role in the struggles of the anarchist war and the wars of the First and Second Barons.
        After its massive expansion by Edward I, the castle fell into disrepair at the end of the Middle Ages,
          and its stones were used to build the surrounding colleges 
        During the English Civil War, the castle was reused and fortified again, but it was soon neglected again;  It was used as a county prison 
       The castle was demolished after the construction of a new prison for the county in 1842 AD in its courtyard.  The prison was also demolished in 1932
