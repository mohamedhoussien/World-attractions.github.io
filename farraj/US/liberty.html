    <p class="history">
        It was 1865 when Frenchman Édouard de Laboulaye
        proposed the idea of presenting a monumental gift
        from the people of France to the people of the United States.
        An ardent supporter of America,
        Laboulaye wished to commemorate the centennial of the Declaration of Independence
        as well as celebrate the close relationship between France and America.

        Bartholdi’s design encompassed much symbolism: her crown representing light
        with its spikes evoking sun rays extending out to the world; the tablet,
        inscribed with July 4, 1776 in Roman numerals, noting American independence;
        to symbolize the end of slavery,
        Bartholdi placed a broken shackle and chains at the Statue’s foot.

    <p>The original model of the statue was inspired by the figure of a female peasant, enlarged to colossal
        proportions. The full text of the post reads, “The original statue was a black woman given to us by France to
        pay homage to the slaves that were brought here by force.</p>

    <p>The statue's crown bears seven spikes, symbolizing the seven oceans and seven        continents   of the world, and
        emphasizing her message of welcome, inclusiveness, and freedom. Can you spot her from here, on nearby Ellis
        Island, many new Americans' first stop in their new life?</p>

    <p>Standing proud, exposed to the elements, the statue has to withstand around 600 lightning bolts every year and,
        in high winds, the torch can sway by about 5 inches side-to-side!</p>
