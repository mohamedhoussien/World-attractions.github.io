    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="park\over.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Central Park, largest and most important public park in Manhattan, New York City. It occupies an area of 840
        acres (340 hectares) and extends between 59th and 110th streets (about 2.5 miles [4 km]) and between Fifth and
        Eighth avenues (about 0.5 miles [0.8 km]). It was one of the first American parks to be developed using
        landscape architecture techniques.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <img src="park\history.jpg" alt="">
    <p>In the 1840s the increasing urbanization of Manhattan prompted the poet-editor William Cullen Bryant and the
        landscape architect Andrew Jackson Downing to call for a new, large park to be built on the island. Their views
        gained widespread support, and in 1856 most of the park’s present land was bought with about $5,000,000 that had
        been appropriated by the state legislature. The clearing of the site, which was begun in 1857, entailed the
        removal of a bone-boiling works, many scattered hovels and squalid farms, free-roaming livestock, and several
        open drains and sewers. A plan was devised by the architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux that would
        preserve and enhance the natural features of the terrain to provide a pastoral park for city dwellers; in 1858
        the plan was chosen from 33 submitted in competition for a $2,000 prize. During the park’s ensuing construction
        millions of cartloads of dirt and topsoil were shifted to build the terrain, about 5,000,000 trees and shrubs
        were planted, a water-supply system was laid, and many bridges, arches, and roads were constructed.</p>

    <p>Central Park is free, but has its own paid shares of attractions as well. With its vastness, you'll definitely
        need a guide to help you pinpoint exactly where to go, and what to do within it if you're pressed for time.
    </p>

    <p>No matter how you choose to explore Central Park, don't forget just how big the park is. Central Park spans 2.5
        miles from top to bottom and is half a mile wide. It takes about an hour to walk at a brisk pace from top to
        bottom without stopping and much longer if you want to stop and appreciate any of its destinations.
    </p>

    <p>There are 129 people living in Central Park, according to the 2020 United States Census, a more than 400%
        increase since the 2010 Census, when 25 individuals reported living there. At least 90 towns in Texas reported
        having fewer residents than Manhattan's largest park.</p>

    <p>Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, Central Park influenced the development of urban parks
        nationwide and is widely regarded a masterpiece of landscape architecture. Central Park is a National Historic
        Landscape (1963) and a Scenic Landscape of the City of New York (1974).</p>

    <p>Cars are only allowed on the Park drives during specific times, and regulations differ for each one. Note that
        the speed limit in Central Park is always 25mph in all areas, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
