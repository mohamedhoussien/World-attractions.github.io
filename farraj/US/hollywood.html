    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="hollywood/over.jpg">
    <p>
        Hollywood is an entertainment icon, and famous landmarks such as the TCL Chinese Theater and the star-studded Walk of Fame attract a huge number of tourists. Other highlights include Paramount Pictures and established music venues, such as the Hollywood Bowl and the Dolby Theater where the Academy Awards are held. Stand-up comedy clubs, vintage and unique bars and fancy nightclubs cater to visitors of all kinds. The locals mean the restaurants scattered in the Thai Quarter.

    <p>
        Hollywood was laid out as a subdivision in 1887 by Harvey Wilcox, who was a prohibitionist from Kansas. However, real-estate magnate H.J. Whitley transformed Hollywood into a wealthy and popular residential area. Hollywood became a municipality in 1903 and was incorporated into Los Angeles in 1910.

    <p>It will take a few hours - keep in mind that it's street after street Whit stars on them and during the time you are walking down the street, there will be souvenir stores along with other attractions that you may want to check out. I would plan to be out at least 4 hours. Remember it's Hollywood - enjoy your time.</p><hr>

    <p>The Walk of Fame is free to visit, and runs fifteen blocks along Hollywood Boulevard (between N La Brea Avenue and N Gower Street). This bustling street is also home to restaurants and shops, vintage movie palaces, fun museums, and celebrity impersonators with uncanny resemblances.</p><hr>

    <p>The distance between Hollywood and Disneyland is 31 miles. The road distance is 32.6 miles. How do I travel from Hollywood to Disneyland without a car?</p><hr>

    <p>On February 9, 1960, the official groundbreaking ceremony is held for the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The first star to be dedicated on the historic walkway belonged to the actress Joanne Woodward, an Academy Award winner for The Three Faces of Eve (1957).</p><hr>
