    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="empire\overview.jpg">

    <p>
        Our main deck observatory on the 86th floor has been the setting for dozens of movie<br> and television scenes,
        as well as tens of millions of unforgettable moments.<br><br>

        The open-air observation deck wraps around the building’s spire, providing 360-degree views of New York,
        Brooklyn, Queens, and beyond.<br> On the clearest days, this unforgettable view spans six states, offering
        glimpses of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Delaware.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <img src="empire/history.jpg">
    <p>
        Bethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25-story office building on the Waldorf–Astoria
        site.<br> The company's president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid $100,000 of the $1 million down payment required to
        start construction on the building, with the promise that the difference would be paid later. Brown borrowed
        $900,<br> 000 from a bank, but then defaulted on the loan.<br> After Brown was unable to secure additional
        funding, the land was resold to Empire State Inc.<br> , a group of wealthy investors that included Louis
        G.Kaufman, Ellis P. Earle, John J. Raskob, Coleman du Pont, and Pierre S. du Pont.<br> The name came from the
        state nickname for New York.<br> Alfred E. Smith, a former Governor of New York and U.S. presidential candidate
        whose 1928 campaign had been managed by Raskob, was appointed head of the company.<br> The group also purchased
        nearby land so they would have the 2 acres (1 ha) needed for the base, with the combined plot measuring 425 feet
        (130 m) wide by 200 feet (61 m) long.
        <br> <br>
        The Empire State Inc. consortium was announced to the public in August 1929.<br> Concurrently, Smith announced
        the construction of an 80-story building on the site, to be taller than any other buildings in existence.<br>
        Empire State Inc.<br> contracted William F.<br> Lamb, of architectural firm Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, to create
        the building design.<br> Lamb produced the building drawings in just two weeks using the firm's earlier designs
        for the Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as the basis.<br> Concurrently, Lamb's partner
        Richmond Shreve created "bug diagrams" of the project requirements.<br> The 1916 Zoning Act forced Lamb to
        design a structure that incorporated setbacks resulting in the lower floors being larger than the upper
        floors.<br> Consequently, the building was designed from the top down, giving it a "pencil"-like shape.<br> The
        plans were devised within a budget of $50 million and a stipulation that the building be ready for occupancy
        within 18 months of the start of construction.

    <h2>Inside pictures</h2>
    <img src="empire\1.jpg">
    <p>Opened in 1931, the Empire State Building is the world's most famous office building, a historical landmark, and
        was named "America's Favorite Architecture" in a poll conducted by the American Institute of Architects. It's no
        surprise that visiting this amazing building is one of the top places to visit in New York.</p>
    <img src="empire\2.jpg">
    <p>Visitors can enter the building for free if they have bought New York City Pass or the New York Explorer Pass.
        Both the Passes let you skip the queue at the Empire State's ticketing counter and go straight to the 86th-floor
        observatory for free.</p>
    <img src="empire\4.jpg">
    <p> There are no time limits or specified visiting windows. Allow at least one hour for your visit, slightly more if
        you will be visiting both the main deck and the top deck.
    </p>
    <img src="empire\5.jpg">
    <p>First, you have to decide which floors you want to visit. Main Deck access includes access to the observation
        deck on the 86th floor, as well as all the exhibits on the 2nd and 80th floors. Top Deck access includes the
        above, as well as access to the 102nd floor observation deck.</p>
