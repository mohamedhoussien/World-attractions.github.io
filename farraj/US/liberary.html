    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="liberary\over.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        New York Public Library (NYPL), one of the great libraries of the world and the largest city public library in
        the United States. It was established in 1895 through the consolidation of the privately endowed Lenox and Astor
        libraries and the $2,000,000 Tilden Foundation trust.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <img src=" liberary\history.jpeg" alt="" height="fit-content" width="900px">
    <p>
        The origins of this remarkable institution date back to the time when New York was emerging as one of the
        world's most important cities. By the second half of the 19th century, New York had already surpassed Paris in
        population and was quickly catching up with London, then the world's most populous city. Fortunately, this
        burgeoning and somewhat brash metropolis counted among its citizens men who foresaw that if New York was indeed
        to become one of the world's great centers of urban culture, it must also have a great library.

        Prominent among them was one-time governor Samuel J. Tilden (1814-1886), who upon his death bequeathed the bulk
        of his fortune — about $2.4 million — to "establish and maintain a free library and reading room in the city of
        New York."

        All members of the public are welcome to attend the Library's public programs, subject to any occupancy limits
        and, where applicable, ticketing requirements.
