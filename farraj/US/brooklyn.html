    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="broklyn\over.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The Brooklyn Bridge looms majestically over New York City's East River, linking the two boroughs of Manhattan and
        Brooklyn. Since 1883, its granite towers and steel cables have offered a safe and scenic passage to millions of
        commuters and tourists, trains and bicycles, pushcarts and cars.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <img src="broklyn\history.jpg" alt="" height="60%" width="60%">
    <p>Brooklyn Bridge, suspension bridge spanning the East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan in New York City. A
        brilliant feat of 19th-century engineering, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first bridge to use steel for cable
        wire, and during its construction explosives were used inside a pneumatic caisson for the first time.</p>

    <p>Upon its completion in 1883 it became the first roadway to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn, which were then
        separate cities (Brooklyn became part of New York City in 1898). Back then, with a central span of 1,595 feet,
        the Brooklyn Bridge was also the world's longest suspension bridge.
    </p>

    <p>The bridge had cost US$15.5 million in 1883 dollars (about US$416,625,000 in 2020) to build, of which Brooklyn
        paid two-thirds. The bonds to fund the construction would not be paid off until 1956. An estimated 27 men died
        during its construction.

    <p>On May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge over the East River opened, connecting the great cities of New York and
        Brooklyn for the first time in history. Thousands of residents of Brooklyn and Manhattan Island turned out to
        witness the dedication ceremony, which was presided over by President Chester A.</p>

    <p>On May 17, 1884, Barnum marched 21 elephants across the bridge, along with 17 camels. The animals made it across
        just fine, proving that the bridge was steady. At the time it opened, it was the longest suspension bridge in
        the world, and it lives on today as one of New York's finest landmarks.

    <p>you can walk from end to end, the bridge is just over one mile of walking. Along the way, you'll have some
        amazing views of both Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. Whether you're walking towards Manhattan or
        Brooklyn, you'll see places on the route that include: One World Trade Center
    </p>

    <p>The bridge accommodates six lanes of automobile traffic, and there's no toll for vehicles crossing the Brooklyn
        Bridge. The wide, central pedestrian and bike pathway is shared and elevated above the traffic whizzing by just
        below.
